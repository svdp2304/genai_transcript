A: Good morning, you're through to [Bank Name] Fraud Department, my name is Sarah. How can I help you today?
C: Oh, thank goodness. Sarah, I'm really worried. I've just checked my online banking and something is seriously wrong.
A: I understand you're concerned. Can you please tell me what you've noticed?
C: Well, first, I got a text message last week, saying there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link. I didn't click it, but then a few days later, a new credit card arrived at an address I don't recognise. And now, I see a huge cash advance on my existing card that I didn't take out, sent via Faster Payments!
A: I see. That certainly sounds alarming, and we need to investigate this immediately. To confirm your identity, can I please take your full name and date of birth?
C: It's [Customer Name], [Date of Birth].
A: Thank you, [Customer Name]. I'm just accessing your account now. You mentioned a new credit card to an unknown address and a cash advance via Faster Payments. Can you tell me the approximate amount of the cash advance and the sort code it was sent to, if you have it?
C: It was about five thousand pounds, and the sort code... I don't remember it exactly, but it wasn't one of my usual ones. It just says 'Faster Payments Outgoing'. And the new card was sent to somewhere in Birmingham, but I live in Manchester!
A: Right. This is consistent with an account takeover attempt. I need to ask you some important security questions. When did you last successfully log into your online banking portal yourself, before noticing these issues?
C: Uh, I log in quite regularly. Maybe a few days ago? Or was it last week? I'm not sure. I've been getting so many fake bank alerts lately.
A: I understand. Have you recently received any unusual emails or text messages purporting to be from the bank, asking you to click on links or verify details?
C: Yes, loads! Like I said, I got one last week about suspicious activity. I didn't click it, I'm usually careful with those. But I did log in directly to check my account after one of them.
A: And when you logged in, did you use your usual device, for example, your personal laptop or mobile phone?
C: Yes, my laptop. Why?
A: We're trying to establish if your login credentials may have been compromised. Have you ever shared your online banking password, PIN, or any One-Time Passcodes, also known as OTPs, with anyone, even if they claimed to be from the bank or police?
C: No, never! I know not to do that. But my password is one I use for a few things, maybe that's it?
A: Thank you for being honest. It's possible your details were part of a third-party data breach, which fraudsters then use to try and access accounts. Our systems show some unusual login activity preceding these transactions. Based on what you've described, particularly the new card to an unknown address and the Faster Payments cash advance, this appears to be a sophisticated account takeover fraud.
C: So what happens now? Am I going to lose my money?
A: Please don't worry, we're here to help. The first thing I'm going to do is immediately block your existing credit card and freeze your online banking access to prevent any further unauthorised activity. We will then raise a full fraud investigation. The funds sent via Faster Payments will be traced, and we will attempt to recover them from the recipient bank. This process can take some time, but we will keep you updated.
C: What about the new card?
A: That card will also be cancelled and flagged. We will not be sending any replacement cards to that unauthorised address. We will send a new card to your registered home address, but only once we've ensured your account is secure.
C: Okay. And those texts and emails?
A: Those were likely phishing or smishing attempts designed to trick you into revealing your details or to cause panic. Please remember, we will never ask you to click on a link in an email or text message to log in, nor will we ever ask for your full password or OTP. Always log in directly via our official website or app.
A: I also strongly advise you to change all your online passwords, especially for any accounts where you may have reused the same password as your banking login. We'll also report this incident to UK Finance, which helps track industry-wide fraud trends. You might also consider reporting this to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime.
C: Right, okay. Thank you, Sarah. I'm just so stressed.
A: I understand this is very distressing, but we are taking all the necessary steps. We will be in touch within three working days with an update on our investigation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, [Customer Name]?
C: No, I think that's everything. Thank you.
A: You're welcome. Please ensure you keep your devices secure and remain vigilant about unsolicited communications. Have a good day.
C: You too. Goodbye.
A: Goodbye.
