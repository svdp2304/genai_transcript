**Agent (Dave):** Good morning, you're through to David. How can I help you today?

**Customer (Eleanor):** (Voice trembling slightly) Oh, thank goodness. David, I… I think I've been scammed. I'm… I'm just so upset, I don't know what to do.

**Agent (Dave):** Take a deep breath, Mrs. Vance. It sounds like you've had a very distressing experience. My name is David Miller, and I'm a Senior Fraud Specialist here. Please, tell me what's happened, and I'll do everything I can to help you.

**Customer (Eleanor):** I… I made a payment yesterday. A very large payment. To… to what I thought was an investment company. And now I can't get hold of them, and I've looked online, and it just… it all feels wrong.

**Agent (Dave):** I understand this is incredibly distressing, Mrs. Vance. Let's take it one step at a time. Can you please confirm your full name and the first line of your address for security?

**Customer (Eleanor):** Yes, it's Eleanor Vance. V-A-N-C-E. And it's 27 Willow Lane, Littlehampton, BN17 5XY.

**Agent (Dave):** Thank you, Mrs. Vance. And can I just confirm the date of birth associated with this account?

**Customer (Eleanor):** It's the 14th of April, 1958.

**Agent (Dave):** Perfect, thank you. Right, Mrs. Vance, you mentioned a payment you made yesterday. Can you tell me which account it was made from?

**Customer (Eleanor):** My main current account, the one ending in 7890.

**Agent (Dave):** Okay, I have that account pulled up. Now, you said you believe you've been scammed. Can you tell me a little more about this payment? Who did you send the money to, and what was it for?

**Customer (Eleanor):** It was for an investment. They called themselves "Global Horizon Investments." They had a very professional-looking website, brochures, everything. They were offering these amazing returns on… on green energy bonds. Said it was a limited-time offer, very exclusive.

**Agent (Dave):** I see. And how much was this payment, Mrs. Vance?

**Customer (Eleanor):** £45,000. It was my life savings, David. Everything.

**Agent (Dave):** (Slight pause, tone becomes more serious but still empathetic) £45,000. And when exactly was this payment made yesterday? Do you remember the time?

**Customer (Eleanor):** It was in the afternoon, around… I think it was about 2:30 PM. I was on the phone with their 'advisor,' a Mr. Thompson, and he was walking me through it. Said I needed to act quickly to secure the rate.

**Agent (Dave):** Right. So, you were on the phone with this Mr. Thompson, and he instructed you to make the payment. Was this a Faster Payment, or a BACS transfer, do you recall?

**Customer (Eleanor):** He said it was a Faster Payment, so it would clear straight away. He gave me the account number and sort code.

**Agent (Dave):** Thank you. And can you tell me the sort code and account number you sent the funds to, please?

**Customer (Eleanor):** Yes, it was sort code 20-34-56 and account number 98765432. The account name was given as "GHI Client Account."

**Agent (Dave):** Thank you, Mrs. Vance. I'm just checking our system now. Okay, I can see that payment for £45,000 to sort code 20-34-56, account 98765432, made yesterday at 14:32. Now, when you were setting up the payment online or in the app, did you receive any warnings from the bank? For example, did the 'Confirmation of Payee' system flag that the name didn't match, or did you get a warning about potential fraud?

**Customer (Eleanor):** (Hesitates) Well, it did say something about the name not being an exact match for "Global Horizon Investments." But Mr. Thompson had already explained that. He said because it was a 'client holding account' for a large firm, it would come up as "GHI Client Account" and that was perfectly normal. He said it was just the bank being overly cautious. And I just… I trusted him. He sounded so genuine.

**Agent (Dave):** I understand, Mrs. Vance. Scammers are very sophisticated and often have convincing explanations for those warnings. Did you, at any point, check if "Global Horizon Investments" was registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, the FCA?

**Customer (Eleanor):** Oh, I meant to! He sent me a link to what looked like an FCA registration number, but I didn't actually go to the FCA website myself to check it independently. I just… I was so caught up in the excitement of the potential returns. He said I'd be earning almost 10% a year, guaranteed!

**Agent (Dave):** I see. Unfortunately, "guaranteed" high returns are a classic red flag for investment scams, especially when combined with pressure to act quickly. The FCA maintains a warning list of companies to avoid. It's always crucial to verify any investment firm directly on the FCA register before sending any money.

**Customer (Eleanor):** (Voice breaking) I know that now, don't I? Oh, David, what can you do? Can you get my money back?

**Agent (Dave):** Mrs. Vance, I need to be upfront with you. As this was a Faster Payment, the funds would have been transferred almost instantly to the recipient account. Once a Faster Payment leaves your account and is received by the other bank, it's incredibly difficult to recall. We will, however, initiate what's called a 'trace and recall' request with the receiving bank immediately. This means we'll contact them to inform them this was a fraudulent payment and request the funds be returned.

**Customer (Eleanor):** So, there's a chance?

**Agent (Dave):** The success rate for recovering funds in these types of investment scams, where the money has gone to a fraudster's account and has likely been moved on very quickly, is unfortunately very low. However, we will do everything within our power as your bank to try. The receiving bank will investigate their customer's account. If the funds are still there and they can confirm the fraudulent nature, they may be able to freeze them. But often, the money is moved out very quickly.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Oh, dear. So, what happens next?

**Agent (Dave):** First, I'm going to log this as a confirmed fraud case on your account. This will protect you from any further unauthorised activity related to this incident. I'll also place a temporary block on any outbound Faster Payments from your account, just as an extra precaution, which we can review later.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Thank you.

**Agent (Dave):** Secondly, I strongly advise you to report this to Action Fraud immediately. That's the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime. They will give you a crime reference number, which is vital. This will allow the police to investigate, and it's also a requirement if you later decide to escalate your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Action Fraud… how do I do that?

**Agent (Dave):** You can do it online at actionfraud.police.uk, or by calling them on 0300 123 2040. They are open 24/7 online, and phone lines are open Monday to Friday. I'll send you an email with their details and your fraud case reference number from us. It's really important that you provide them with as much detail as possible: the names, the website, phone numbers, emails, anything you have.

**Customer (Eleanor):** I've got emails, yes. And a few text messages.

**Agent (Dave):** Excellent. Every piece of information helps. Thirdly, as I mentioned, we'll initiate the trace and recall request. This process can take up to 10 working days for the receiving bank to respond to us. We will keep you updated on any developments.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Ten working days… it feels like an eternity.

**Agent (Dave):** I understand, Mrs. Vance. It's a difficult waiting game. While we await their response, I'd also like to give you some advice for the future. Please be extremely wary of any unsolicited contact regarding investments, especially those promising high or guaranteed returns. Always check the FCA register directly for any firm you're considering investing with. And if you ever have doubts about a payment, even if a scammer is pressuring you, please stop and call us on the number on the back of your bank card. We would rather you called us a hundred times unnecessarily than fall victim to a scam.

**Customer (Eleanor):** I just feel so foolish.

**Agent (Dave):** Mrs. Vance, please don't feel foolish. These criminals are extremely sophisticated, and they target vulnerable people with convincing stories. You are not alone; we see cases like this unfortunately far too often. It's not your fault that you were targeted.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Thank you, David. That… that helps a little.

**Agent (Dave):** Is there anything else you remember about this Mr. Thompson or "Global Horizon Investments"? Did they ask you to download any software, or give them remote access to your computer?

**Customer (Eleanor):** No, not remote access. But they did send me a link to download their 'secure client portal' app on my phone. I logged in a few times, but it just showed my 'investment' growing. It was all fake, wasn't it?

**Agent (Dave):** Yes, Mrs. Vance, it sounds like that was part of their elaborate deception. I would strongly recommend you uninstall that app immediately from your phone. And if you used the same password for that app as you do for anything else, especially your banking, please change all those passwords as soon as possible.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Oh, good heavens, yes, I will.

**Agent (Dave):** Finally, once we have a response from the receiving bank regarding the trace, if we are unable to recover your funds, you do have the right to take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. They are an independent body that can review your case and our handling of it. I'll include their details in the email as well.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Okay. So, Action Fraud first, then wait for you, then the Ombudsman if it doesn't work out.

**Agent (Dave):** That's correct. I'll send you that email summary within the next hour. It will contain your fraud reference number, the Action Fraud contact details, the Financial Ombudsman Service details, and a brief overview of the steps we've taken and what happens next.

**Customer (Eleanor):** Thank you, David. You've been very kind.

**Agent (Dave):** You're very welcome, Mrs. Vance. I know this is a tough time, but please remember we're here to support you. Is there anything else I can assist you with right now, or any other questions you have?

**Customer (Eleanor):** No, I think… I think you've covered everything. I just need to try and calm down now.

**Agent (Dave):** Please do. And if anything else comes to mind, or if you receive any further contact from these individuals, please do not engage with them and call us back straight away.

**Customer (Eleanor):** I certainly will. Goodbye, David.

**Agent (Dave):** Goodbye, Mrs. Vance. Take care.
